## Exercise 1

Run the touch-input.py file to start the webcam video. Then callibrate the sensor by following the steps on screen or in the documentation.md. After that, touch Events should be shown as blue bounding boxes and hover events as green bounding boxes.

## Exercise 2 

Launch the touch input first and callibrate. Then start the application-launcher.py file, which should initialize the three images randomly. Then:

1. You can drag an image by touching it somewhere in the center and moving the finger.
2. You can resize an image by touching two diagonal corners and moving the finges in opposite directions or together.
3. You can rotate an image to the right by touching the two adjancent corners left and right, like bottom right and top right or bottom left and top left.
4. You can rotate an image to the right by touching the two adjancent corners top and bottom, like bottom right and bottom left or top right and top left.

Furthermore, hover events are shown as green circles and touch events as blue circles.
## Exercise 3

Launch the application-launcher.py file. A small window should appear. To launch the programs, you can either draw within the window with a mouse, or if connected, use the touch input to draw on it. When there are no inputs for some time, the program will evaluate the drawn symbol and launch the according file.
